# SDMGroup - Species Distribution Modeling Discussion Group

## Description
Currently the number of papers using Species Distribution Modeling / Ecological Niche Modeling approaches has increased significantly. However, the concepts and strategies of these approaches is in full development. For this, the goal of this group is discussing problems and challenges involving Species Distribution Models/Ecological Niche Modeling through interactions with peoples of different labs and different views.

## Group strategy
The group is placed at São Paulo State University, UNESP, in Rio Claro city, São Paulo, Brazil. We have make weekly meetings, lasting 3 hours, to discuss subjects about Species Distribution Models/Ecological Niche Modeling like dataset of occurrences and variables, kinds of variables, extension and resolution of variables, algorithms, software and mainly discuss the problems associated to building of prediction models of participants’ projects. 

## Group meet
The meet occur all the wednesday, at 10 h - 12 h AM, in Department of Ecology, UNESP-Rio Claro.
